# Memory

## Overview

This is a memory game made with HTML, CSS, and JS. To begin, it opens a start screeen where you can hit the start button. It will bring you to the game screen which should have a 4 by 4 grid of cards face-down. The timer will begin and you can click on cards to start playing. The card you click will flip over and stay flipped over until you click a second card. Then it will check if the card images match. If they do, then the cards will stay flipped over (image-side up) and you can click on another card to continue playing. Each pair that you click will count as one move on the moves counter. The game will end when you complete all the matches on the board. 

### How to Run
