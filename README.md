# Memory

##Overview
This is a memory game made with HTML, CSS, and JS. To begin, it opens a start screeen where you can hit the start button. It will bring you to the game screen which should have a 4 by 4 grid of cards face-down. The timer will begin and you can click on cards to start playing. The card you click will flip over and stay flipped over until you click a second card. Then it will check if the card images match. If they do, then the cards will stay flipped over (image-side up) and you can click on another card to continue playing. Each pair that you click will count as one move on the moves counter. The game will end when you complete all the matches on the board. 

###How to Run
To run this, you will need to have visual studio code. Below is the link to download VS code: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
After you have VS code, you can get the "live server" extension under the extension tab on the left hand side. Then download the index.html, styles.css, app.js, and images folder off this repository and open the folder in VS code. Finally, go into the index.html and press ctrl+p and enter ">live server:open with live server". This will open a browser with the memory game where you can play it on your own computer. 

###Acknowledgements
